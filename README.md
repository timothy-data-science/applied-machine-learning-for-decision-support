# Applied Machine Learning for Decision Support

## Module Overview
This module introduces machine learning as a decision-support capability rather than
a black-box prediction engine. Students learn how to frame problems, compare models,
and interpret results responsibly.

---

## Intended Learning Outcomes
Students will be able to:
1. Translate real-world problems into ML tasks
2. Build and compare baseline machine learning models
3. Evaluate models using appropriate metrics
4. Interpret model outputs to support decisions
5. Recognise limitations, bias, and misuse of models

---

## Teaching Philosophy
Interpretable models are prioritised before complex techniques to ensure conceptual
clarity and responsible use.

---

## Topics Covered
- Problem formulation
- Training and validation concepts
- Logistic regression and decision trees
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Explainability and ethics

---

## Why Not Start with Deep Learning?
This module intentionally delays deep learning to:
- Build statistical intuition
- Reduce misconceptions
- Reinforce interpretability and trust

---

## Assessment Ideas
- Case-based ML mini-project
- Written justification of model choice
- Reflection on ethical considerations
